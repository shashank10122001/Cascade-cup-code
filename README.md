# Cascade-cup 2020 code 

## Classifier model for the Cascade Cup-2020
This repository consists of the code written to build a machine learning classifier model.
We were given a dataset about an app and its user demographics and user search and watch history, we were asked to predict the users' age on the basis of the data. The age was classified into 4 major categories or age groups. The predicted age would further help the app in streamlining it's reccomendations to its user base. 
The code was written jointly with my teammate Aryan Srivastava.
